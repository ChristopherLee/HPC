# Roomy Parameters

# The total amount of RAM available to Roomy per node (in MB)
PARAM MB_RAM_PER_NODE 1024

# The total amount of disk space avaiable to Roomy per node (in GB)
PARAM GB_DISK_PER_NODE 1

# Set to 1 if all nodes have access to a shared namespace (e.g. using SAN),
# set to 0 if each node has its own local disk.
PARAM SHARED_DISK 1

# The path to store disk-based data structure in. This path must exist, and
# be the same on every node. A directory named "roomy" will be created there.
# Path can not contain spaces.
# NOTE: it is important that this path be on a local disk, or a
# high-performance storage system. Storing data elsewhere, e.g., in a home
# directory on an NFS server, can greatly reduce performance.
PARAM DISK_DATA_PATH /home/kunkle/data/
